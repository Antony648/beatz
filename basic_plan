	Phase 0 — single-process functional player
Read one WAV file with libsndfile and play via libao / ALSA in same process.
Implement simple blocking playback, play/pause, next/prev from stdin keyboard to test logic.
Use a ring buffer if you want decoder separate from output.

	Phase 1 — daemon + CLI
Add Unix domain socket server in the player process.
Implement a minimal CLI that connects and sends PLAY/PAUSE/INFO.
Make the player respond to commands while playing.
Add playlist queue, next and prev logic.

	Phase 2 — daemonize & single-instance
Implement proper daemonizing (or provide systemd unit).
Ensure CLI starts daemon if not running (or prints helpful message).
Lock socket with exclusive bind; use PID file optional.

	Phase 3 — format support & shuffle
Add libmpg123, libsndfile, or ffmpeg to support MP3/FLAC/etc.
Implement shuffle queue (Fisher-Yates shuffle of remaining queue).

	Phase 4 — TUI + advanced features
Implement beatz -show TUI with ncurses or notcurses.
Show current song, progress bar, next songs, controls. TUI should poll for status or subscribe to updates over socket.
Add volume control, equalizer (visualization), crossfade.

	Phase 5 — polish
Persistent playlists, resume last position, system notifications (libnotify), MPRIS or DBus integration optional.
